# SaaS Birthday Garden #

Revelers in the kindergarten who wish to activate the systems will be required to install this app on their device. 
•	The app will include an interface for uploading music, videos, text and presentations to dedicated folders in the cloud compartmentalized by dates or event names.
•	A computer at the event on which the application will be installed will download from the cloud the content of the specific event in order to display it at the event.
•	The application will build an interface that will include a menu for selecting the relevant content for each event, including the option to plan and schedule the presentation of content at the event.
•	It will be possible to choose between the content of the event without prior planning and present it immediately at the event, such as playing background music, displaying a video on the screen, etc.
