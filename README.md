# SassMeister #

Become a Sass master with SassMeister, the Sass playground.


## Installation ##

```
git clone https://github.com/jedfoster/SassMeister.git
cd SassMeister
bundle install
```

Certain features of the app depend on the GitHub API. In production the app's GitHub credentials are stored in environment variables, but in development I use a YAML file to store those. You'll need to [register your app with GitHub](https://github.com/settings/applications/new). Once you have your client ID and secret, rename `config/github.example.yml` to `config/github.yml` and paste in your app's credentials. Mine looks something like this:

```yaml
client_id: 9ef1xxxx
client_secret: 5784xxxxxxxx
```

**FAIR WARNING:** Your client ID and secret should _not_ be shared publicly. Do not commit github.yml to your repo, especially if you post your repo on GitHub. Read the instructions for configuring Heroku with your credentials, below.

Once you have your `config/github.yml` file:

```
rake server
# Rock and Roll
```

Go to [127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) and start playing with Sass!


### GitHub authentication on Heroku ###

Since the YAML file with your API credentials is not committed to your repo, it won't be sent to Heroku, so we need another way of storing that information. Enter Heroku environment variables:

```
heroku config:set GITHUB_ID=9ef1xxxx
heroku config:set GITHUB_SECRET=5784xxxxxxxx
heroku open
# Rock and Roll, again.
```


## Tests

Test code for each of the included Sass libraries can be found [here](https://github.com/jedfoster/SassMeister/blob/master/TESTS.md).

## Caveats

@imports will probably not work the way you'd expect. Spriting with Compass will definitely not work.

If you find anything else that doesn't work, please let me know.

## RVM
SassMeister is includes a `.rvmrc` example file named `.rvmrc.example`. To use this file, simply run from the command line `$cp .rvmrc.example .rvmrc` and edit as needed. 

`.rvmrc` is ignored from the `.gitignore` file, so it is suggested to copy it versus move the file and thus deleting `.rvmrc.example` from your forked project.
